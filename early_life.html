                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the
                    modern-day municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier of the Austrian
                    Empire.</p>
                <p>He remembered the words of his mother, citing her in his autobiography: “My boy, if you wish to go
                    out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide
                    yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing...”</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German
                    elementary school in Perlez. He was one of the best students, receiving a scholarship due to his
                    potential and talent recognized by a local archpriest.</p>
                <p>After challenges with Austro-Hungarian police authorities due to his involvement in the “Serbian
                    Youth” movement, Pupin moved to Prague for further studies, which he later continued in the United
                    States after his father's death led to financial hardships.</p>

                <h2>Studies in America and Ph.D</h2>
                <p>After arriving in America with just five cents, Pupin worked as a manual laborer while learning
                    English, Greek, and Latin. His academic journey continued at Columbia College, leading to a Ph.D.
                    from the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz.</p>
                <p>He became a lecturer of mathematical physics at Columbia University, pioneering in carrier wave
                    detection and X-ray imaging technologies.</p>
