                <h2>Introduction to Pupin Coils</h2>
                <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", was a groundbreaking
                    advancement in telecommunications.</p>

                <h2>Historical Background</h2>
                <p>The technology followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician
                    Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.</p>

                <h2>Patent Acquisition and Impact</h2>
                <p>The importance of the patent was recognized when the American rights to it were acquired by American
                    Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making Pupin wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made
                    little use of it as they had their own development led by George Campbell and had up to this point
                    been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.</p>
                <p>AT&T feared losing control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly
                    extend the range of long-distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
